I am a [Hermann-Weyl Instructor](https://math.ethz.ch/fim/postdocs.html) at the FIM (Institute for Mathematical Research) and the department of mathematics at ETH Zurich, mentored by [Afonso S. Bandeira](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~abandeira/index.html). 

My research is at the intersection of high-dimensional statistics, probability theory, statistical physics, information theory and random matrix theory.

Before coming to ETH, I defended my PhD in Theoretical Physics in 2021 in Ecole Normale Supérieure de Paris, under the supervision of [Florent Krzakala](https://florentkrzakala.com/), and the additional guidance of [Lenka Zdeborová](https://people.epfl.ch/lenka.zdeborova).
I am very glad to have received the [2021 Daniel Guinier Prize](https://www.sfpnet.fr/laureats-des-grands-prix-de-theses-2021-de-la-sfp) of the French Physical Society for it! You can find my PhD thesis [here](uploads/phd_thesis.pdf).

For students, 
please have look at the [teaching section](#teaching).
